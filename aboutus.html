        Description: The web based application will have following
    </p>
    <p>
objectives: Activity wise quantification of Carbon emission in Coal Mines Estimation of existing Carbon Sinks Gap analysis between C emission and sinks and suggesting pathways to carbon neutrality
    </p>
    <p>
Expected Solution: A comprehensive software solution that
    </p><ol>
includes:
<li>
Emission estimation: The app would allow users to input data on various mining activities (e.g., excavation, transportation, equipment usage) and estimate the associated carbon emissions based on establishd emission factors.
</li>
<li>
Estimation of Per Capita emissions of a Mine.
</li>
<li>Carbon Neutrality Pathways: The app could offer features for simulating different emission reduction strategies like: Clean technologies: Assessing the impact of adopting electric vehicles, methane capture systems, and renewable energy sources for mine operations. Afforestation offsets: Calculating the amount of land required for tree plantation to offset remaining emissions based on state specific afforestation plan and Carbon emission reduction. Other Renewables: explore alternative use of energy to reduce direct electricity consumption. Any other pathways: Carbon Credits: Estimation of potential Carbon credit earned as per present market rates. Data visualization: The app should present results visually, using charts and graphs to track emission trends and the effectiveness of implemented strategies. Scalability: Design the app to accommodate different mine sizes and types (underground vs open-cast). Benefits: Transparency: Providing a clear picture of a mine's carbon footprint. Decision support: Helping mine operators make informed choices for emission reduction. Cost savings: Identifying opportunities to optimize operations and potentially reduce costs associated with emissions. Sustainability goals: Aiding Indian coal mines in their journey towards carbon neutrality and supporting the country's overall climate goals.
